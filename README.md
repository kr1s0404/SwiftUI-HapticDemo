## Description

- A simple SwiftUI APP to demonstrate how to use haptic function on iPhone 

- There will be two views for you to choose. First one demonstrate the default haptic that APPLE gives. The second view is the custom haptic view. Which you can adjust the slider to feel differnt vibration.
